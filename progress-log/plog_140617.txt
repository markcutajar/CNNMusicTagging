Things to do this week and some pointers:

1. Fix that the model can be trained in the cloud in distributed mode.
	This would allow faster training, that wouldn't use computational
	resources of the laptop. Thus can be outside with the laptop of
	and travelling whilst the model is training.
	
2. The accuracy of the model checks whether the tag with the highest 
	probability is the same as the one of the target. This is 
	conceptually not correct for this case. THe auroc is also not 
	the best since it calculates the number of false positives and 
	false negatives. However, since it is used in papers, the auroc
	can be modified to cater for this situation.
	
3. Equal error can be used as a method of accuracy. The different
	accuracies possible to be use need to be brainstormed and hence
	the most applicable one can be used.

4. It is useful to seperate the targets into related softmax tags
	such as genre or emotion. Thus, creating a subset which can help
	the network distriminate between different tags.
	
5. For downsampling i can make use of SOX. This, manages to
	downsample well be passing the audio through a lowpass filter
	prior to downsampling it.
	
6. My reasoning is that the network is not managing to get good error
	rates due to the complexity of the tags. The network is to shallow
	to effectively model the audio well and extract features that relate
	to the specific tags.
	
7. A confusion matrix should be implemented in order to see what is
	happening to the tags and if they are being labelled well and which 
	tags are being mistaken by other tags. This could also shine light on
	whether a certain tag is always set to true by the network and hence
	that is what levelling the error.
	
8. Another task for this week is to deepen the network and see if this
	provides better results. This would confirm wether the problem of the
	error is in fact the modelability of the network or some other factor.
